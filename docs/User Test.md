Observed issues:
1. when I turn my phone horisontally the app stays in vertical mode - I thought we adjsuted so that it picks up if the phone moves horisontal and displays like that?
2. Our zone structure is not dynamic - so what happened on the apassimento wines is that it suggested some moves and I did them but then we ran out of space and the next Appesimento wine - Passione Real Appesimento it wants to move to Row 8 which is Rioja and does not make sense, so it also needs to be able to flexibly increase collection zones to accomodate more bottles correctly and or group other zones together to the cellar stays organised and logical without doing what is jsut did





4) Buying guide strategy (no code, just product logic)
A. Start with a “Cellar Strategy Wizard” (2–4 minutes)

Ask:

How many bottles do you want “ready to drink” vs “for ageing”?

What do you actually cook most weeks (pick top 5)?

Do you prefer lighter and fresher, or richer and oaked?

Any grapes/regions you love or hate?

How often do you entertain?

Budget bands (everyday / weekend / special)

B. Define a simple target portfolio (coverage over cleverness)

Create a default “broad pairing” base, then customise:

Everyday versatile whites (high acid, low oak)

Food-friendly reds (medium body, balanced tannin)

One aromatic wildcard (spice, Asian food, tricky veg)

One richer white (cream sauces, roast chicken)

One serious red (steak, lamb, slow-cooked)

Sparkling (apertif, salty snacks, celebrations)

Optional: dessert/fortified only if they drink it

This becomes the buying guide’s backbone.

C. Gap analysis from the user’s actual cellar

Show the user:

“You have plenty of bold reds, but you’re missing crisp whites and sparkling.”

“Your drinking windows cluster in 2026–2027; you have little for 2030+.”

“Your fridge-ready selection is narrow (too many similar styles).”

D. Convert gaps into a shopping list with roles, not brands

Recommend “roles” and example styles:

“Crisp saline white” (Muscadet, Albariño, Vermentino)

“Aromatic white” (Riesling, Gewürztraminer in dry/off-dry)

“Chillable red” (Gamay, Pinot Noir)

“Structured age-worthy red” (Nebbiolo, Rioja Reserva, Bordeaux blend)

Let users choose producers they like, but keep the role-based system stable.

E. Close the loop with lightweight feedback

After each bottle:

1-click rating: “Loved / Liked / Meh / Never again”

Optional: “What did you eat with it?”

Optional: “Too acidic / too oaky / too tannic / too sweet”

Over time, your buying guide shifts from generic coverage to their house style.
