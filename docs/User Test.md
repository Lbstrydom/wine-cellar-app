Observed issues:
1. I think we need to capture the find pairing dialogues, this is a gold mine of informaiton about the user's preferences, taste profile, etc and also we should make it intuitive so that the user can give feedback on which option they chose and how they found the pairing, maybe jsut with an easy 1 to 5 scale working in 0.1 increments and a slider or something - what do you think, how can we build this wihtout complicating things but still extracting valuable data and feeding it back into our user profile. On this subject, are we actively building a user profile, is that implicit in the database or should we slightly expand that as well to improve our AI recomendations and the user cellar manager and use experience?





4) Buying guide strategy (no code, just product logic)
A. Start with a “Cellar Strategy Wizard” (2–4 minutes)

Ask:

How many bottles do you want “ready to drink” vs “for ageing”?

What do you actually cook most weeks (pick top 5)?

Do you prefer lighter and fresher, or richer and oaked?

Any grapes/regions you love or hate?

How often do you entertain?

Budget bands (everyday / weekend / special)

B. Define a simple target portfolio (coverage over cleverness)

Create a default “broad pairing” base, then customise:

Everyday versatile whites (high acid, low oak)

Food-friendly reds (medium body, balanced tannin)

One aromatic wildcard (spice, Asian food, tricky veg)

One richer white (cream sauces, roast chicken)

One serious red (steak, lamb, slow-cooked)

Sparkling (apertif, salty snacks, celebrations)

Optional: dessert/fortified only if they drink it

This becomes the buying guide’s backbone.

C. Gap analysis from the user’s actual cellar

Show the user:

“You have plenty of bold reds, but you’re missing crisp whites and sparkling.”

“Your drinking windows cluster in 2026–2027; you have little for 2030+.”

“Your fridge-ready selection is narrow (too many similar styles).”

D. Convert gaps into a shopping list with roles, not brands

Recommend “roles” and example styles:

“Crisp saline white” (Muscadet, Albariño, Vermentino)

“Aromatic white” (Riesling, Gewürztraminer in dry/off-dry)

“Chillable red” (Gamay, Pinot Noir)

“Structured age-worthy red” (Nebbiolo, Rioja Reserva, Bordeaux blend)

Let users choose producers they like, but keep the role-based system stable.

E. Close the loop with lightweight feedback

After each bottle:

1-click rating: “Loved / Liked / Meh / Never again”

Optional: “What did you eat with it?”

Optional: “Too acidic / too oaky / too tannic / too sweet”

Over time, your buying guide shifts from generic coverage to their house style.
