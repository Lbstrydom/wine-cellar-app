Observed issues:
1. on mobile under Cellar Analysis, when at suggested additions for Fridge and I click on add is says Error: Transaction is not a function
2. suggested additions for fridge should first be from reduce now category unless we do not have a wine from that category in which casde it can be suggested from the overall cellar
3. Feature - on mobile allow to sweitch to horisontal viewing so we can see more of thje cellar
4. Feature - wine does not always get drunki in one go, so we should also have an "open" classification - if there are open bottles an additional suggestion for pairing could be to include them if it makes sense, and also we can have them a different color visually onnthe cellar
5. Once cellar analysis is done we should keep it in memory/database - so that it does not have to redo it every time you go to that tab, and only update when we actually click refresh analysis - in general check what needs to be stored to create an easy PWA experience for the user so that information is easily available for useful items




4) Buying guide strategy (no code, just product logic)
A. Start with a “Cellar Strategy Wizard” (2–4 minutes)

Ask:

How many bottles do you want “ready to drink” vs “for ageing”?

What do you actually cook most weeks (pick top 5)?

Do you prefer lighter and fresher, or richer and oaked?

Any grapes/regions you love or hate?

How often do you entertain?

Budget bands (everyday / weekend / special)

B. Define a simple target portfolio (coverage over cleverness)

Create a default “broad pairing” base, then customise:

Everyday versatile whites (high acid, low oak)

Food-friendly reds (medium body, balanced tannin)

One aromatic wildcard (spice, Asian food, tricky veg)

One richer white (cream sauces, roast chicken)

One serious red (steak, lamb, slow-cooked)

Sparkling (apertif, salty snacks, celebrations)

Optional: dessert/fortified only if they drink it

This becomes the buying guide’s backbone.

C. Gap analysis from the user’s actual cellar

Show the user:

“You have plenty of bold reds, but you’re missing crisp whites and sparkling.”

“Your drinking windows cluster in 2026–2027; you have little for 2030+.”

“Your fridge-ready selection is narrow (too many similar styles).”

D. Convert gaps into a shopping list with roles, not brands

Recommend “roles” and example styles:

“Crisp saline white” (Muscadet, Albariño, Vermentino)

“Aromatic white” (Riesling, Gewürztraminer in dry/off-dry)

“Chillable red” (Gamay, Pinot Noir)

“Structured age-worthy red” (Nebbiolo, Rioja Reserva, Bordeaux blend)

Let users choose producers they like, but keep the role-based system stable.

E. Close the loop with lightweight feedback

After each bottle:

1-click rating: “Loved / Liked / Meh / Never again”

Optional: “What did you eat with it?”

Optional: “Too acidic / too oaky / too tannic / too sweet”

Over time, your buying guide shifts from generic coverage to their house style.
