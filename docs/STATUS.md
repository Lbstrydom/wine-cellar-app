### 10. Reduce-Now Priority List

**5-Level Priority System**:
1. **Critical** - Past drinking window, drink immediately
2. **High** - At peak, should drink within weeks
3. **Medium** - Approaching peak, drink within months
4. **Low** - Early peak, can wait but worth tracking
5. **Watch** - Monitor for changes

**Reduce Reasons**:
- Drinking window urgency
- Age-based (wines over threshold years)
- Quality concerns
- Space requirements
- Duplicate management

**Auto-Evaluation Rules** (configurable):
- Drinking window urgency threshold (months)
- Wine age threshold (years)

**Zone Capacity Management** ✨ NEW (8 Jan 2026):
- **Proactive Detection**: Alerts when zone reaches capacity and wines would fall back to unrelated zones
- **AI-Assisted Recommendations**: Claude Opus analyzes situation and suggests:
  - **Expand**: Allocate additional row to overflowing zone
  - **Merge**: Combine related zones (e.g., Appassimento + Amarone → "Italian Dried-Grape")
  - **Reorganize**: Move lower-priority wines to make room
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: User reviews AI reasoning and approves individual actions
- **Automatic Execution**: Apply buttons execute zone changes and refresh analysis
- **Fallback Option**: User can ignore alert and use fallback placement if preferred

**Holistic Zone Reconfiguration** ✨ NEW (8 Jan 2026):
- **Grouped Banner**: When ≥3 zones overflow OR ≥10% bottles misplaced, shows single grouped banner instead of multiple alerts
- **Two-Path UX**: "Quick Fix Individual Zones" for minor issues vs "Full Reconfiguration" for systemic issues

- **Skip Individual Actions**: User can uncheck specific actions before applying
- **Plan Preview Modal**: Shows summary (zones changed, bottles affected, misplaced reduction estimate)
- **Heuristic Fallback**: Conservative row expansion when Claude not configured
- **Zone Pins**: Protect zones from being merged (never_merge constraint)
- **15-minute Plan TTL**: Generated plans expire after 15 minutes for security

### Zone Reconfiguration Robustness - 9 January 2026
Fixed critical issues with AI-generated zone reconfiguration plans and improved post-reconfiguration UX:

**Problem Solved**: AI was suggesting row reallocations for rows that zones didn't actually own (e.g., "R10 is not assigned to rioja"), causing crashes when applying plans.

**Fixes Implemented**:

1. **Graceful Stale Plan Handling** (`src/routes/cellar.js`):
   - `reallocateRowTransactional()` now returns status object instead of throwing
   - Returns `{ success: false, skipped: true, reason: "..." }` for invalid rows
   - Apply endpoint continues with remaining actions instead of aborting
   - Tracks `actionsAutoSkipped` count in response

2. **Post-Reconfiguration Success Banner** (`zoneReconfigurationBanner.js`):
   - New `renderPostReconfigBanner()` function
   - Shows "Zone Reconfiguration Complete" (green success style) instead of "Zone Configuration Issues Detected"
   - Lists bottles that need to physically move: wine name → target zone (current slot)
   - Shows first 8 items, summarizes remaining
   - Hint to use "Suggested Moves" section for actual bottle moves

3. **Clearer AI Zone ID Instructions** (`zoneReconfigurationPlanner.js`):
   - Enhanced prompt to clarify zone IDs are strings like "curiosities", not numbers like "4"
   - Explicit examples and warnings about zone ID format
   - Added `actualAssignedRows` validation at plan generation time

4. **Two-Phase Process Clarification**:
   - Phase 1: Zone reconfiguration changes row ownership (which zones own which rows)
   - Phase 2: Suggested Moves physically relocates bottles to match new zone boundaries
   - Users now understand the distinction via improved UX messaging

**Commits**: `211381b`, `5416e82`, `9661553`

### GPT-5.2 AI Reviewer - 9 January 2026
Implemented a GPT-5.2 review layer to validate and patch AI-generated plans from Claude across three domains:

**Architecture**: Planner (Claude Opus 4.5) → Reviewer (GPT-5.2) → Validator (deterministic)

**Coverage**:
1. **Zone Reconfiguration** - Reviews cellar-wide restructuring plans
2. **Cellar Analysis** - Reviews AI-generated cellar organization advice
3. **Zone Capacity Advice** - Reviews recommendations for zone overflow situations

**New Files**:
- `src/services/openaiReviewer.js` - GPT-5.2 review service with Structured Outputs
- `src/routes/admin.js` - Telemetry endpoints for sommelier review
- `data/migrations/026_ai_review_telemetry.sql` - Telemetry table
- `docs/AI_REVIEWER_TEST_LOG.md` - Sommelier feedback log template

**Features**:
- **Structured Outputs**: Uses Zod schema with `responses.parse()` for guaranteed JSON compliance
- **Diff-like Patches**: Targeted field-level fixes with `action_id` (not full plan replacement)
- **Circuit Breaker**: 3-failure threshold, 5-minute auto-reset
- **Telemetry**: Comprehensive tracking (plan hashes, token usage, latency, stability score)
- **Sommelier Feedback Loop**: Rating and notes storage for quality assessment
- **Stability Score**: 0-1 metric measuring plan disruption (higher = less churn)
- **Configurable Timeout**: 120s default for complex reviews (env: `OPENAI_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- **Reasoning Effort**: Medium by default for quality/speed balance (env: `OPENAI_REVIEW_REASONING_EFFORT`)

**Integration Points**:
- `zoneReconfigurationPlanner.js` - Reviews zone reconfiguration plans
- `cellarAI.js` - Reviews cellar analysis advice
- `zoneCapacityAdvisor.js` - Reviews zone capacity recommendations

**Admin Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/admin/ai-reviews` - List recent reviews (supports `?pending=true` filter)
- `PATCH /api/admin/ai-reviews/:id/rating` - Add sommelier rating (1-5)

**Feature Flags** (set in Railway environment):
- `OPENAI_REVIEW_ZONE_RECONFIG=true` - Enable zone reconfiguration review
- `OPENAI_REVIEW_CELLAR_ANALYSIS=true` - Enable cellar analysis review
- `OPENAI_REVIEW_ZONE_CAPACITY=true` - Enable zone capacity review

---

### OpenAI SDK Integration - 9 January 2026
Added OpenAI SDK support for optional GPT model access:

- Installed `openai` and `zod` npm packages
- Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable support
- Enables GPT-5.2 reviewer for zone reconfiguration plans

---

### Self-Contained Test Infrastructure - 8 January 2026
Refactored test suite to eliminate manual server coordination:

**Problem Solved**: Integration tests required manually starting the dev server, leading to ECONNREFUSED failures and fragile VS Code task orchestration.

**Solution**:
- Vitest `globalSetup` in `tests/integration/setup.js` auto-spawns server before tests
- Server waits for `/health/live` to respond before tests run
- Server killed automatically after tests complete
- Graceful fallback: reuses existing server if already running

**New npm Scripts**:
- `npm run test:unit` - Fast unit tests only (~0.5s, no server)
- `npm run test:integration` - Integration tests with auto-managed server (~3s)
- `npm run test:all` - Both in sequence (recommended before commits)

**New Files**:
- `tests/integration/setup.js` - Server lifecycle management
- `tests/integration/vitest.config.js` - Integration-specific Vitest config

**Updated Documentation**:
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated with new test commands
- "Do" checklist now includes running `npm run test:all` before commits

### Holistic Zone Reconfiguration Audit - 8 January 2026
Comprehensive audit verified all physical constraint enforcement claims:

**Verified Implementations**:
1. **Physical Constraint Constant**: `TOTAL_CELLAR_ROWS = 19` enforced in planner (7 references throughout codebase)
2. **Zone Utilization Tracking**: `buildZoneUtilization()` and `findUnderutilizedZones()` functions calculate row usage per zone
3. **AI Prompt Prohibitions**: Claude prompts explicitly state "DO NOT suggest expand_zone" and enforce working within fixed row count
4. **Heuristic Fallback**: When AI unavailable, conservative `reallocate_row` actions from underutilized to overflowing zones
5. **Transactional Row Moves**: `reallocateRowTransactional()` safely moves rows between zones with atomic updates
6. **UI Action Rendering**: Modal correctly displays "Reallocate Row X from Zone A → Zone B" for `reallocate_row` actions
7. **Plan Apply Endpoint**: Handles `reallocate_row` action type alongside legacy `merge_zones` and `retire_zone`

**Test Validation**: All 333 tests passing (312 unit + 21 integration)

---

### Zone Capacity AI Management - 8 January 2026
Implemented proactive AI-assisted zone management to prevent illogical overflow suggestions:

**Problem Solved**: When a zone fills up (e.g., Appassimento), the system was silently falling back to unrelated zones (e.g., Rioja), creating confusing organization suggestions.

**Solution Architecture**:
- **Detection**: `cellarAnalysis.js` tracks `zoneCapacityIssues` when wines can't be placed in their target zone
- **Alert UI**: `zoneCapacityAlert.js` displays prominent warning with affected wines list
- **AI Advisor**: `zoneCapacityAdvisor.js` sends zone context to Claude Opus for analysis
- **Action Execution**: Three action types (allocate_row, merge_zones, move_wine) with Apply buttons

**New Files**:
- `src/services/zoneCapacityAdvisor.js` - Claude integration with JSON schema validation
- `public/js/cellarAnalysis/zoneCapacityAlert.js` - Alert UI and action handlers

**New API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/cellar/zone-capacity-advice` - Get AI recommendations
- `POST /api/cellar/zones/allocate-row` - Assign row to zone
- `POST /api/cellar/zones/merge` - Merge source zone into target

**Frontend API Functions** (`api.js`):
- `getZoneCapacityAdvice(payload)` - Request AI analysis
- `allocateZoneRow(zoneId)` - Execute row allocation
- `mergeZones(sourceZoneId, targetZoneId)` - Execute zone merge

**CSS Styles**: `.zone-capacity-alert`, `.zone-capacity-advice-panel`, `.zone-capacity-action` classes

**Buffer Zone Fix** (8 Jan - follow-up):
- Fixed bug where buffer zones (like `red_buffer`) would place wines in rows allocated to other zones
- When `enforceAffinity` is true, buffer zones now skip rows that are allocated to specific zones
- This prevents Appassimento wines from being suggested into Rioja-allocated rows just because they're both "red"
- Fix location: `cellarPlacement.js` line 297-316

**Holistic Zone Reconfiguration** (8 Jan - follow-up):
- Addresses "alert spam" when multiple zones overflow simultaneously
- Single grouped banner replaces 6+ individual alerts
- Two-path UX: Quick Fix (per-zone) vs Full Reconfiguration (cellar-wide)
- **Physical Constraint Enforcement** (8 Jan - critical fix):
  - Cellar has fixed 19-row limit - planner now works WITHIN this constraint
  - New action type: `reallocate_row` - moves rows between zones (not expand beyond limit)
  - AI prompt explicitly forbids adding rows beyond physical limit
  - Heuristic fallback also works within constraints
  - Red/white row allocation can flex for seasonality (more whites in summer, more reds in winter)
  - AI can suggest zone restructuring (geographic → style-based or vice versa)
- New files:
  - `src/services/zoneReconfigurationPlanner.js` - Claude-powered plan generation with physical constraints
  - `src/services/reconfigurationPlanStore.js` - In-memory plan storage with 15min TTL
  - `src/services/reconfigurationTables.js` - PostgreSQL tables for zone_pins and history
  - `src/services/zonePins.js` - Zone pin constraints (never_merge)
  - `public/js/cellarAnalysis/zoneReconfigurationBanner.js` - Grouped banner UI
  - `public/js/cellarAnalysis/zoneReconfigurationModal.js` - Plan preview modal (supports reallocate_row action)
- Helper functions in `cellar.js`:
  - `reallocateRowTransactional()` - moves a row from one zone to another safely
  - `getAffectedZoneIdsFromPlan()` - extracts zone IDs including from reallocate_row actions
- New API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/cellar/reconfiguration-plan` - Generate holistic plan
  - `POST /api/cellar/reconfiguration-plan/apply` - Apply plan with optional skips (supports reallocate_row)
- Database tables: `zone_pins`, `zone_reconfigurations`
- Trigger logic: ≥3 capacity alerts OR ≥10% misplacement rate

### Move Integrity & Data Protection - 7-8 January 2026
Critical fix for bottle loss bug during cellar reorganization moves:

**Root Cause**: Two moves with the same wine name could target the same slot, causing one bottle to be overwritten and lost.

**Swap Detection & Protection** ✨ NEW (8 Jan):
- Detects when moves involve swaps (Wine A→B while B→A) or dependencies (move targets occupied slot)
- Frontend calculates swap pairs and dependent moves directly from move data
- **Three action types**:
  - **Swap button**: For swap pairs - executes both moves atomically
  - **Move button**: For independent moves - executes single move
  - **🔒 Lock icon**: For dependent moves (target occupied by bottle being moved elsewhere)
- **Individual swap execution**: `executeSwap()` lets users execute swap pairs one at a time safely
- **Smart warnings**: Different messages for swaps ("Use Swap buttons") vs dependencies ("Execute all together")
- Bidirectional arrow (↔), SWAP badge, and swap partner info for swap moves
- Swap status re-calculated after each action (if dependencies resolve, buttons unlock)
- Applied to both cellar reorganization and fridge organization features

**Modular cellarAnalysis.js Refactoring** ✨ NEW (8 Jan):
- Split 1,699-line monolith into 8 focused modules (all <425 LOC)
- Pattern matches `bottles/` folder refactoring
- Modules: state.js, analysis.js, aiAdvice.js, moves.js, fridge.js, zones.js, zoneChat.js
- Entry point (`cellarAnalysis.js`) reduced to 99-line thin facade
- All functionality preserved, CSP-compliant event handlers maintained

**Validation System (`movePlanner.js`)**:
- `validateMovePlan()` function with 5 validation rules:
  1. Each wine can only be moved once (no duplicate wine IDs)
  2. Each target slot can only be used once (prevents collisions)
  3. Target must be empty OR will be vacated by another move in the plan
  4. Source must contain the expected wine (DB verification)
  5. No-op moves detection (from === to)
- Returns detailed errors with type, message, and context for each failure

**Allocated Target Tracking (`cellarAnalysis.js`)**:
- Added `allocatedTargets` Set to track slots already assigned during batch suggestion generation
- Prevents same slot from being suggested multiple times
- Combines with existing `pendingMoves` tracking for comprehensive collision prevention

**Atomic Move Execution (`cellar.js`)**:
- All moves wrapped in database transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
- Pre-execution validation rejects invalid plans before any changes
- Invalidates analysis cache only after successful completion
- Returns validation details in API response

**Database Constraint (`025_slot_uniqueness.sql`)**:
- Unique partial index: `idx_slots_wine_unique ON slots(wine_id) WHERE wine_id IS NOT NULL`
- Database-level guarantee that one wine can't be in multiple slots
- Complements application-level validation

**Frontend Validation UI (`cellarAnalysis.js`)**:
- Preview modal shows all bottles to be moved before execution
- Validation error modal with categorized errors by type
- Clear explanations and "Refresh suggestions" guidance

**Placement Recommendations (`cellarPlacement.js`)**:
- `recommendPlacement()` function for new bottle additions
- Combines zone matching with slot suggestion
- Returns comprehensive recommendation with alternatives and confidence

**Unit Tests (`movePlanner.test.js`)**:
- 18 comprehensive tests covering all validation rules
- Edge cases: empty arrays, single moves, missing data
- Complex scenarios: swaps, chains, multiple errors

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/movePlanner.js` - Added `validateMovePlan()` function
- `src/services/cellarAnalysis.js` - Added `allocatedTargets` tracking
- `src/routes/cellar.js` - Added validation and transaction support
- `src/services/cellarPlacement.js` - Added `recommendPlacement()` function
- `public/js/cellarAnalysis.js` - Added preview and validation error modals
- `public/css/styles.css` - Modal styles
- `data/migrations/025_slot_uniqueness.sql` - Database constraint
- `tests/unit/services/movePlanner.test.js` - Full test suite

### Phase 8: Production Hardening - 6-7 January 2026
Comprehensive fixes for Express 5 compatibility, PostgreSQL async patterns, and production stability:

**Express 5 Compatibility Fixes**:
- **Path pattern fix**: Changed `/api/*` wildcard to middleware wrapper (path-to-regexp v8 incompatibility)
- **Query parameter handling**: Express 5 makes `req.query` getter-only; validation middleware now stores coerced values in `req.validated.query`
- **Zod coercion**: Updated `paginationSchema` to use `z.coerce.number()` for proper string→number conversion

**PostgreSQL Async/Await**:
- **Awards routes**: Added `async/await` to all 15 route handlers (PostgreSQL returns Promises, SQLite is synchronous)
- **Cellar routes**: Converted zone metadata endpoints to async/await (`/api/cellar/zones/:zoneId/intent`, etc.)
- **Pairing routes**: Converted zone metadata access in pairing service to async/await
- **Ratings routes**: Fixed async patterns in rating fetch endpoints
- **JobQueue service**: Converted all methods to async with proper PostgreSQL SQL syntax (`RETURNING *` vs SQLite's `lastInsertRowid`)
- **Database abstraction**: All `db.prepare().get/all()` calls now properly awaited throughout codebase

**Mobile Accessibility (Phase 8.11)**:
- **Text size setting**: Small/Medium/Large options in Settings with localStorage persistence
- **Touch targets**: Buttons and tabs now min-height 44px (WCAG 2.5.5 compliance)
- **iOS zoom prevention**: Form inputs use 16px font-size on mobile to prevent auto-zoom
- **Reduced motion**: `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
- **Keyboard hint**: Hidden on mobile/touch devices
- **Focus visible**: Improved keyboard navigation styles

**Browser Test Suite** (46 tests passing):
- Health endpoints (3 tests)
- Metrics endpoint (8 tests)
- Pagination with numeric types (8 tests)
- Input validation (6 tests)
- Security headers (6 tests)
- Service worker v29 (4 tests)
- Event listener cleanup (3 tests)
- Error boundary (2 tests)

**Cache Management**:
- Service worker cache version v29
- Asset versioning `?v=20260106f` for cache busting
- Global search duplicate overlay prevention

### Railway + PostgreSQL Migration - 6 January 2026
- **Migrated from Fly.io to Railway**: Auto-deploy from GitHub, simpler deployment model
- **Database moved to Supabase PostgreSQL**: Replaced SQLite with cloud-hosted PostgreSQL
- **Database abstraction layer**: Auto-selects SQLite (local) or PostgreSQL (production)
- **Route handler updates**: All handlers converted to async/await for PostgreSQL compatibility
- **SQL syntax updates**: STRING_AGG, ILIKE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL syntax
- **Custom domain**: `cellar.creathyst.com` via Cloudflare CNAME to Railway
- **Removed legacy files**: fly.toml, deploy.ps1, sync-db.ps1, Synology-specific configs
- **Documentation updates**: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, STATUS.md updated for new deployment

### UX & Bug Fixes - 5 January 2026
- **Direct Wine Swap**: Drag wine onto occupied slot → confirmation dialog → swap positions
- **Auto-Scroll During Drag**: Page scrolls automatically when dragging near viewport edges
- **Zone Classification Fix**: Fixed Portuguese wines being misclassified as "Dessert & Fortified"
  - Bug: `/port/` regex matched "Portugal", "Portuguese", "Porto"
  - Fix: Word-boundary regex patterns (`\bport\b`) to match only "Port" wine style
  - Affected wines: Coutada Velha Signature, Baia de Troia Castelao, R de Romaneira

### Deploy Script Improvements - 5 January 2026
- **SSH Key + Sudo Fix**: Deploy script now pipes password for sudo commands even when using SSH key authentication
- **Warning Filter**: Suppresses irrelevant SSH warnings (post-quantum, password prompt noise)

### SonarQube Code Quality Review - 7 January 2026
Comprehensive code quality audit addressing security, maintainability, and best practices:

**Security Fixes**:
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Fixed string interpolation in ratings.js DELETE query → parameterized placeholders
- **CSP Hardening**: Removed `unsafe-inline` from script-src directive (all JS now external modules)
- **Race Condition Fix**: Added promise lock pattern to JobQueue to prevent concurrent job processing
- **Input Validation**: Added Zod schema validation to bottles.js with regex patterns for location codes
- **Rate Limiting**: Added 5 requests/hour limit to backup export endpoints

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- **Optional Chaining**: Converted `!obj || !obj.prop` patterns to `!obj?.prop` in slots.js
- **Number.parseInt**: Added explicit radix parameter to all parseInt calls in wines.js
- **String.replaceAll**: Modernized regex replace to replaceAll in backup.js CSV escaping
- **Unused Imports Cleanup**: Removed 17 unused imports across 10 files (cellarHealth.js, awards.js, wines.js, acquisitionWorkflow.js, drinkNowAI.js, movePlanner.js, pairingEngine.js, health.js, app.js)

- API endpoints: PUT /api/slots/:location/open, /seal, GET /open
- Gold border visual indicator with 🍷 icon
- "Mark Open/Sealed" toggle in bottle modal

**Phase 3b - Issue 6: Fridge Zone Categorization (DONE)**

- Zoom controls (+, -, reset) in cellar header
- Ctrl+scroll wheel zoom for desktop
- Zoom level persisted in localStorage

### CSP Event Handler Audit - 7 January 2026
Discovered and fixed silent failures caused by CSP blocking inline event handlers.

**Root Cause**: CSP `script-src 'self'` blocks inline `onclick="..."` handlers without visible errors.

**Files Refactored**:
- `public/js/cellarAnalysis.js` - 12 inline onclick handlers → addEventListener
- `public/js/errorBoundary.js` - 1 inline onclick handler → addEventListener
- `public/js/recommendations.js` - 1 inline onclick handler → addEventListener
- `public/js/bottles/wineConfirmation.js` - 1 inline onerror handler → addEventListener
- `public/index.html` - 4 inline handlers in Zone Chat UI → wired in JS

**Prevention**:
- Added regression test: `tests/unit/utils/cspInlineHandlers.test.js`
- Test scans all `public/` files for `on*="..."` patterns and `javascript:` URLs
- Fails build if inline handlers are reintroduced
- Audit guide: `docs/EVENT_HANDLER_AUDIT.md`

### Pairing Feedback & User Profile - 7 January 2026
Implemented comprehensive feedback loop for wine pairing recommendations:

**Database Migrations**:
- `023_pairing_sessions.sql` - Tracks every pairing interaction (dish, recommendations, user choice, feedback)
- `024_user_taste_profile.sql` - Derived user preferences (colours, styles, regions, failure patterns)

**Backend**:
- `src/services/pairingSession.js` - Session persistence, choice recording, feedback collection
- API endpoints: `/api/pairing/sessions/:id/choose`, `/api/pairing/sessions/:id/feedback`
- `sessionId` returned from sommelier recommendations for tracking
- Failure reasons vocabulary (12 controlled terms)

**Frontend**:
- "Choose This Wine" button on recommendation cards
- Feedback modal with rating slider (1-5) and "would pair again" toggle
- Failure reasons checkboxes (shown when rating ≤ 2.5)
- Modal triggered after wine selection

**Data Flow**:
1. User requests pairing → session saved with dish, signals, recommendations
2. User clicks "Choose This Wine" → choice recorded with rank
3. Feedback modal → rating and failure reasons stored
4. Future: Profile recalculation from accumulated feedback

### Security & Code Quality - January 2026
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy middleware with production/dev modes
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory rate limiter (100 req/15min general, 10 req/1min for AI)
- **Error Boundary**: Global frontend error handling with user-friendly toasts
- **Database Transactions**: Atomic operations for slot moves, swaps, and bottle additions
- **Prepared Statement Cache**: Reusable queries for common database operations
- **ESLint Cleanup**: Fixed all 25 lint warnings (unused variables, prefer-const)
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint tests for wines, slots, pairing, rate limiting

### Deployment Automation - January 2026
- **Deploy Script**: `.\scripts\deploy.ps1` with pre-flight checks
  - Runs ESLint before deployment
  - Runs tests if configured
  - Prompts for uncommitted changes
  - Git push → SSH pull → Docker build/up
  - Verifies container and tests API
- **Options**: `-Quick` (fast deploy), `-SkipTests`, `-Logs`

### Custom Domain Setup - January 2026
- **Custom Domain**: `https://cellar.creathyst.com` for PWA installation
